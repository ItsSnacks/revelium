<h3>Mammon</h3>

<img src="Mammon-George-Frederick-Watts-1884-1885-Tate-London.jpg" alt="archival image" class="inline-image">

<p>Mammon was worshiped as the main deity by Phoenicians, one of the richest nations of the ancient world. He’s also known as Hell’s Ambassador to England, another very wealthy, trade-oriented country. Mammon is also mentioned in the Bible as Jesus says: “You can’t serve both God and Mammon.”

This is not a coincidence. Mammon is an earth demon, very powerful and willing to help with finances and hedonistic pursuits. 
When I  summoned Mammon I doubled my income in two months, getting past $2000/month from my websites. 
Here’s a step-by-step ritual for summoning Mammon in case you’re interested.</p>

<p>1. Have a clear goal for Mammon to help you with. Don’t just say “I want to be rich.” Make it more precise. 
Do you want to own a castle? Or perhaps a brand new car, a larger paycheck, ultimate financial freedom? 
Pick one or more goals that are on the same wave-length. Also, make sure that it’s something you ACTUALLY want, not just a crazy idea that popped into your head. 
This is often the problem with summoning demons that I also have. So it has to be something you genuinely want AND are capable of receiving.
Believe it or not, many people are not ready to make a drastic change in their lifestyle, so the combination of desire and fear can lead to diminished results.
It’s better to build up slowly then to take huge leaps forward that you’re not prepared for.</p>

<p>2. Now it’s time to get into a trance. I highly recommend you meditate for 30-60 minutes. 
Take the first 20 minutes or so of your meditation to repeat Mammon’s enn: “Tasa Mammon on ca lirach” This mantra will invite Mammon into your consciousness.
After doing so, imagine being in Mammon’s presence. Be completely physically relaxed and simply observe the sensations that arise or visions that enter your mind.
I found myself in front of a large palace guarded by a long line of giants. I was surrounded by people bowing to these Guardians. 
Maybe you will have a different vision. After this intense experience, draw Mammon’s sigil on a piece of paper (as shown below).
This will channel your physical intent into summoning Mammon, not only your psyche. Now pick up the piece of paper with your dominant hand and gaze at it. 
Channel your energy into the sigil in order for Mammon to appear. Chanting his enn (Tasa Mammon on ca lirach) can be helpful at this point as well.
As you continue to channel energy, you might feel Mammon’s presence in your room or in your body. Tingling sensations on your skin, strange noises, warmth or coldness in the extremities are all common at this stage of the ritual.</p>

<p>3. You’ve evoked Mammon! Congratulations. But this is the crucial part of the ritual. You must communicate your desire and ask Mammon for help.
First of all, never act like a beggar, never say please, please, please. You are the Creator of Mammon at this point in Time.
You are in some ways at the top of the hierarchy, and Mammon is there to help you as a knight would help his Lord, not as a Lord throwing a few coins to a beggar on the street. 
Treat every demon you summon with respect, but never place yourself below the demon, otherwise it will take control of you instead.</p>
